# Now What?

Ever finish binging a show and think to yourself: "Now what"? Ever sit through the credits of
a video game, trying to figure out how you're ever going to follow that up? Here's a tool to help!


## Description

**Now What?** lets you input all of your current or future shows, movies, games, or other activities
into categorized lists, and randomly selects one for you to tackle next. Each category, and the items
within that category, are editable, sortable, and toggleable. The randomizer button on the main page
will only choose from items that are currently toggled on. So next time you think to yourself, "now what?",
we've got you covered.



## Features

- Preset categories with ability to add/edit/delete/re-order
- Free-form input for items in each category, with the ability to add/edit/delete/re-order those as well
- Toggle each category or item individually
- Favorites (extra weight for favorited items)


## Roadmap

- Platform selection and tagging
  - New section next to categories for platforms
    - Both buttons should now indicate how many items are toggled on
  - Toggled the same way - no favorites though (?)
  - Add ability to tag items with platform (REQUIRED FIELD)
  - If specific platforms are toggled on, only randomize items with that tag
- Link to streaming/gaming platforms to import watchlists
  - Add fixed list (more to come) of integrations available (other platforms can be added without integration)
  - Auto-fill / create (if not exists) categories for items in watchlist / playlist on those platforms and tag them properly
  - Sync on app startup, also give refresh button
- Search current list
- Items can have number of participants (nullable), randomizer can filter based on min/max/equals
- Login and account-based saves (share your lists between devices)
- Add friends, share lists (?)
- Recommendations based on friend's lists and favorites (?)
- Smart home integration (??)
