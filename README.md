# NowWhat

Ever finish binging a show and think to yourself: "Now what"? Ever sit through the credits of
a video game, trying to figure out how you're ever going to follow that up? Here's a tool to help!


## Description

**Now What?** lets you input all of your current or future shows, movies, games, or other activities
into categorized lists, and randomly selects one for you to tackle next. Each category, and the items
within that category, are editable, sortable, and toggleable. The randomizer button on the main page
will only choose from items that are currently toggled on. So next time you think to yourself, "now what?",
we've got you covered.



## Features

- Preset categories with ability to add/edit/delete/re-order
- Free-form input for items in each category, with the ability to add/edit/delete/re-order those as well
- Toggle each category or item individually



## Roadmap

- Link to streaming/gaming platforms to import watchlists
- Weighted choices (i.e. make it 2x more likely to select a TV show vs a game)
- Favorites (extra weight for favorited items)
- Saved filter sets for randomization - i.e. have a button for 'select media (TV/movies)' or 'select a game (all platforms)'
- Platform selection and tagging, randomizer can select based on platform/tags
- Items can have number of participants, randomizer can filter based on min/max
- Login and account-based saves (share your lists between devices)
- Add friends, share lists (?)
- Recommendations based on friend's lists and favorites (?)
- Smart home integration (??)
